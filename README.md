**Title:** [Mental Health Dashboard](https://github.com/AjeneJo/Ajene.github.io/blob/main/Student%20Mental%20Health%20Analysis.xlsx)

**Tools Used:** Advanced Microsoft Excel (Pivot table, Pivot charts, Slicers, Timeline)

**Project Description:** This project focused on analyzing student mental health data collected during online learning. The aim was to uncover behavioral, emotional, and lifestyle factors that impact student 

well-being and academic performance. The analysis was designed to inform educators, counselors, and academic institutions about trends in stress, screen time, physical activity, sleep patterns, and therapy impact.

The dashboard includes interactive features that allow stakeholders to:

Compare average screen time across different stress levels and education groups.

Analyze the relationship between physical activity and both stress levels and academic performance.

Examine average sleep duration and screen time across gender and education levels.

Assess the prevalence of exam anxiety across various demographics.

Understand the distribution of stress levels among the student population.

**Key findings:** High Stress Linked to Screen Time: Students with higher stress levels spent significantly more time on screens.

Physical Activity Helps: Regular physical activity correlated with reduced stress and better academic performance.

Gender Differences in Sleep: Average sleep duration and screen time patterns varied by gender and education level.

Exam Anxiety Prevalence: A notable number of students experienced pre-exam anxiety, especially in certain demographics.

Stress Patterns: Most students reported moderate stress levels, with a sizable percentage reporting high stress, suggesting the need for well-being support systems.
