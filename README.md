# Project 1

**Title:** [Mental Health Dashboard](https://github.com/AjeneJo/Ajene.github.io/blob/main/Student%20Mental%20Health%20Analysis.xlsx)

**Tools Used:** Advanced Microsoft Excel (Pivot table, Pivot charts, Slicers, Timeline)

**Project Description:** This project focused on analyzing student mental health data collected during online learning. The aim was to uncover behavioral, emotional, and lifestyle factors that impact student 

well-being and academic performance. The analysis was designed to inform educators, counselors, and academic institutions about trends in stress, screen time, physical activity, sleep patterns, and therapy impact.

The dashboard includes interactive features that allow stakeholders to:

Compare average screen time across different stress levels and education groups.

Analyze the relationship between physical activity and both stress levels and academic performance.

Examine average sleep duration and screen time across gender and education levels.

Assess the prevalence of exam anxiety across various demographics.

Understand the distribution of stress levels among the student population.

**Key findings:** High Stress Linked to Screen Time: Students with higher stress levels spent significantly more time on screens.

Physical Activity Helps: Regular physical activity correlated with reduced stress and better academic performance.

Gender Differences in Sleep: Average sleep duration and screen time patterns varied by gender and education level.

Exam Anxiety Prevalence: A notable number of students experienced pre-exam anxiety, especially in certain demographics.

Stress Patterns: Most students reported moderate stress levels, with a sizable percentage reporting high stress, suggesting the need for well-being support systems.

**Dashboard Overview:** The dashboard includes the following key visualizations:

Average Screen Time by Stress Level and Academic Performance

Physical Activity vs. Stress and Performance

Sleep & Screen Time by Gender and Education Level

Exam Anxiety Distribution Across Demographics

Stress Level Distribution (Pie/Bar Chart)
Interactive Slicers
Gender

Age Group

Education Level

Mental Health Status

Therapy History

Physical Activity Level

**Impact:** This dashboard empowers educators, mental health professionals, and policymakers to:

Make informed decisions based on behavioral patterns.

Prioritize student mental health initiatives.

Adapt academic strategies to improve student well-being during and after online learning transitions.

# Project 2

**Title:** [Addiction Population Dashboard](https://github.com/AjeneJo/Ajene.github.io/blob/main/Addiction%20Population%20Data%201.xlsx)

**Tools Used:** Advanced Microsoft Excel (Pivot table, Pivot charts, Slicers, Timeline)

**Project Description:** This project analyzed population data related to addiction, mental health, physical wellness, and socioeconomic factors. The primary objective was to identify correlations between 

behavioral health and addiction patterns such as smoking and drinking, and to explore how demographic and lifestyle factors influence recovery outcomes.

The interactive dashboard was developed to help healthcare professionals, policymakers, and researchers explore the underlying factors driving addiction severity, therapy effectiveness, and mental health 

status.

**Key findings:** Mental Health & Addiction: Individuals with poorer mental health status tend to show higher smoking and drinking addiction levels.

Lifestyle Impact: Better sleep, regular exercise, and a healthy BMI correlate with reduced addiction scores.

Income & Employment Links: Unemployed individuals and those with lower income levels showed higher addiction tendencies.

Therapy Effectiveness: Those with a history of therapy had slightly lower addiction levels and higher attempts to quit.

Geographic Trends: Certain cities and countries showed disproportionately high addiction levels, indicating regional disparities.

**Dashboard Overview:** The dashboard features several analytical views, including:

Mental Health Status vs. Smoking and Drinking Addiction

Correlation of BMI, Sleep, and Exercise with Addiction Scores

Income and Employment vs. Addiction Severity

Therapy History and Recovery Attempts

Country & City-wise Addiction Mapping

**Impact:** This dashboard serves as a decision-support tool for:

Public health officials targeting interventions by location and demographic.

Researchers studying behavioral health determinants.

Healthcare planners designing therapy and awareness campaigns based on evidence.

# Project 3

**Title:** Work Place Safety Data

**SQL Code:** [Work Place Safety SQL Code](https://github.com/AjeneJo/Ajene.github.io/blob/main/Work_Place_Data.sql)

**SQL Skills Used:** Data Retrieval (SELECT): Queried specific fields and created custom result sets for insights on costs, days lost, and incident counts.

Data Aggregation (SUM, COUNT, AVG, MAX): Calculated total and average incident costs, days lost, and frequencies by plant, department, and incident type.

Data Filtering (WHERE, IN, BETWEEN, AND, OR): Extracted relevant subsets of data, such as “Lost Time” incidents or specific age groups affected by certain hazards.

Grouping and Categorization (GROUP BY): Analyzed incident trends grouped by year, shift, report type, gender, and injury location.

Sorting and Ranking (ORDER BY, LIMIT): Identified top incident types, highest-cost cases, and months with peak incident counts.

Date and Time Handling: Leveraged YEAR and MONTH fields to generate time-series reports.

Aliases and Naming (AS): Cleaned output presentation with readable column names for use in dashboards and exports.

**Project Description:** Developed a comprehensive SQL-driven analysis of workplace incident data to uncover patterns in safety incidents across departments, 

shifts, plants, and demographic groups. The project supported safety strategy improvements by identifying high-risk areas, costly incidents, and common injury 

causes.

**Technology used: SQL server:**

**Outcome:** Enabled data-driven safety interventions and risk assessments. The dashboard provided stakeholders with clear visibility into operational safety
performance, allowing proactive measures to reduce future incidents and costs.
